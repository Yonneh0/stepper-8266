ESP8266 Stepper Controller and Tester

Currently, this project is somewhere before PRE-RELEASE. It was last recorded as being in the "Hold my beer, watch this" phase.

Code is still proof of concept. It is NOT hardened in any way. It is currently blindly open.

Requirements:
`DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver Carrier` https://www.amazon.com/DRV8825-Stepper-Driver-Module-Printer/dp/B07XF2LYC8
`ESP-12S, ESP8266MOD, or similar` https://www.amazon.com/ESP-12S-ESP-12F-Upgrade-ESP8266-Wireless/dp/B07VF7B9XB
`Power` (3.3v 250ma, and 8.2-45V 0-4.4a for Stepper Motor)
